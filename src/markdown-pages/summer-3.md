# Summer Homework #3 ðŸ’» ðŸ¥¥

_New stuff we learned this week:_ ðŸ¤”

## ES Module Syntax

- The long-term replacement for **CommonJS** (`require()`/`module.exports`) is something called **ES Modules**. (The "ES" stands for "Ecmascript", which is technically the name of Javascript).
- ES Modules are **already supported** in _TypeScript_, most _modern browsers_, but _sorta only halfway in Nodejs_ (full node support will eventually be here).
- to create a **NAMED Export**, you just put the keyword `export` in front of whatever identifier you want to export, like this:

```js
// in file: beaver.js
export function sayBeaver() {
  console.log("Beaver");
}

export const BEAVER_NAME = "Walter";
```

- to **consume a NAMED import** you almost always _destructure while using the `import` keyword_, like so:

```js
// in file: main.js
import { sayBeaver, BEAVER_NAME } from "./beaver";
```

- if you don't like the _name provided by the NAMED export_, you can **alias** it when importing:

```js
import { sayBeaver as logBeaver } from "./beaver";
```

- if you want to import **all the NAMED exports** from a file as a single _object_, you can use this syntax:

```js
import * as beaverUtils from "./beaver";

beaverUtils.sayBeaver();
console.log(beaverUtils.BEAVER_NAME);
```

- if a module has **one primary, main export** it's customary to make it the **default export** using the `default` keywordt:

```js
// file: beaver-class.js
export default class Beaver {
  speak() {
    console.log("I am a beaver");
  }
}
```

- to _consume a default export_, you just import it without destructuring or using the `*` symbol:

```js
// file: main.js
import Beaver from "./beaver-class";
```

- a file with a default export _can also have NAMED exports_:

```js
// file: harriet.js
export default function() {
  return "Harriet Henderson";
}

export const nickname = "Ritty";
```

- if you want to import **both a default export and a NAMED export**, you do it like this:

```js
import harriet, { nickname } from "./harriet";
```

- when using Typescript, you can **import/export Types** as well:

```ts
// file person.ts
export type Person = {
  name: string;
  hasBeard: boolean;
};

export function makeJared(): Person {
  return { name: "jared", hasBeard: true };
}
```

```ts
// main.ts
import { makeJared, Person } from "./person";
```

## Homework Plan (next class in 3 weeks)

- 1 day (per week) review all flashcards
- 1 day (per week) touch typing practice
- 1 day setting up SSH access to new HTC VM
- more coming soon...

### Homework (week 1)

<Checkable id="review-flash-1">review all flashcards</Checkable>
<Checkable id="typing-1">touch typing practice</Checkable>
<Checkable id="cccs">Watch CCCS</Checkable>
<Checkable id="ts-1">SSH Homework</Checkable>

---

## SSH Assignment

---

- modify your computers `~/.ssh/config` file so that it connects to the new HTC VM through **port 555**.
- make a nice alias by changing the `Host` to something short like `htc`, which requires that you also set the `HostName` to `howtocomputer.link`
- test your SSH connection to the new VM, you should see the cool HTC ascii-art that I showed you in class
- once you are able to SSH in, Slack me that you got in successfully, once I hear back from all of you, I'll nuke the old VM ðŸ”«
