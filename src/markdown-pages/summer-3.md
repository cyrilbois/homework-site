## SSH Assignment

---

- modify your computers `~/.ssh/config` file so that it connects to the new HTC VM through **port 555**.
- make a nice alias by changing the `Host` to something short like `htc`, which requires that you also set the `HostName` to `howtocomputer.link`
- test your SSH connection to the new VM, you should see the cool HTC ascii-art that I showed you in class
- once you are able to SSH in, Slack me that you got in successfully, once I hear back from all of you, I'll nuke the old VM ðŸ”«
