# Week 31 Homework üíª üê¢

_New stuff we learned this week:_ ü§î

### SSH Keys, etc. üîê

- `ssh` can be made _secure_ with _passwords_ -- but these are very easy to crack, so it is far more common to do SSH securely with **cryptographic keys**.
- ssh keys come in _pairs_ -- a **private** key and a **public** key. The public key _can only be used to ENCRYPT_ something, so it's safe to share. The private key _can decrypt_ so it must be kept secret! Here's what my main public key looks like:

```txt
ssh-rsa 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 jared@netrivet.com
```

- On unix-y computers (linux, mac), the standard place where ssh keys and other ssh goodies go is in a hidden folder at the path: `~/.ssh`. If you don't have this folder, you can make it: `mkdir ~/.ssh`
- The most common name and location for a default ssh key is `id_rsa` in your `~/.ssh/` directory. It has two parts: `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` (which is the _public_ key), and `~/.ssh/id_rsa` which is the _private_ key.
- generating an SSH key is done rarely enough that it's not really useful to memorize the commands (I always google it).
- the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file is a simple, plain-text file with _one public key per line_. This is where a unix-y computer keeps a list of **keys for trusted computers that are allowed to `ssh` in.**
- This means, that **to get _key-based ssh access_ to a computer somewhere**, you need to _put your public key into that computer's_ `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` _file_.
- The first time you connect to a remote computer with `ssh` (using password, or key), your computer will always put up a scary warning saying _Hey! We don't know for sure what this other computer is you're connecting to, are you sure you trust it?_. The warning looks like this:

```bash
The authenticity of host 'radwebsite.com (35.231.145.151)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:HbW3g8zUjNSksFbqTiUWPWg2Bq1x8xdGUrliXFzSnUw.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
```

- theoretically, you're supposed to verify the `fingerprint` to make sure some _hacker_ isn't intercepting your request, but in reality almost noone every does this. If you type `yes`, you'll see this message:

```bash
Warning: Permanently added 'radwebsite.com' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
```

- that message means that now your computer has a **record of the digital fingerprint and IP address for the url `radwebsite.com`**. It keeps this record in a special file at the path `~/.ssh/known_hosts`.
- from that point on, every time you connect to `radwebsite.com` your computer will check that the IP address matches. If it doesn't, you get this scary message:

```bash
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
@    WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!     @
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE IS DOING SOMETHING NASTY!
Someone could be eavesdropping on you right now (man-in-the-middle attack)!
It is also possible that a host key has just been changed.
The fingerprint for the RSA key sent by the remote host is
51:82:00:1c:7e:6f:ac:ac:de:f1:53:08:1c:7d:55:68.
Please contact your system administrator.
Add correct host key in ~/.ssh/known_hosts to get rid of this message.
Offending RSA key in ~/.ssh/known_hosts:12
Host key verification failed.
```

- if you're certain you're not being hacked, (like maybe you own the server and you changed it's IP address), then you just delete the line of `known_hosts` that the warning points you to. (see the second to last line of the example above).
- one more interesting file that you can make in your `~/.ssh` dir is a plain text file called `config`. This is like a place to store `ssh` configuration settings for different hosts. For example, if you always type `ssh tabitha@howtocomputer.link`, you could tell your `config` file that you always want to use the _user_ `tabitha` when connecting to `howtocomputer.link`. You do that like this (in `~/.ssh/config`):

```txt
Host howtocomputer.link
  User tabitha
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

- if you have this in your `~/.ssh/config` file, then you can just type `ssh howtocomputer.link` and you're golden! (I _think_ it also unlocks _tab-completion_ for the host as well üëç).
- if you get confused on any of this, simply refer to this diagram:

### Github / Gitlab

- **GitHub** is a website/company that _facilitates easier collaboration on software projects_ using `git`.
- **GitLab** is the same thing, a competitor/alternative to GitHub.
- inside of GitLab, you can _clone_ a repository owned by someone else by pressing the **fork** button at the top of the repository. The purpose of a fork is usually to be able to push branches to your own copy of a repo, and then possibly open a Pull/Merge request to the original repo.
- a **Merge Request** (or **Pull Request**) is a _request to have a branch merged into another repo_. Github/Gitlab create a nice web page for PRs that allows you to see a web-based `git diff` and to make comments and have a discussion about the proposed changes. The web page has a button (for the repo owner) that allows them to merge the changes with a click.
- Github/Gitlab gives you **ssh clone URLs** so that you can clone repos down to your own computers and work on them there, and then push/pull changes via ssh.
- in order to do git clone/pull/push/fetch using `ssh` you have to paste your computers _public key_ into the web interface. Behind the scenes, GitLab puts your public key into it's `known_hosts` file.

## SSH Homework #1

---

- carefully review the "New stuff" above
- do your flashcard assignment first
- `ssh` into your home dir
- check if you have a `.ssh` folder (you'll have to use a flag to see _hidden_ folders, because the folder begins with a `.`)
- create the `~/.ssh` folder if it doesn't exist, then move down into it
- ok, next we're going to create a brand new SSH key pair, **_NOTE: change the email address in the command below_**
- type this command, substituting your own email address:

```bash
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

- accept the default filename of `~/.ssh/id_rsa`
- lease _passphrase_ **empty** by just hitting _enter twice_
- now do a `ls` and you should see `id_rsa` _and_ `id_rsa.pub`
- cat out both of your key files so you can see the contents
- type a command that will allow you to see the _permissions_ of both of your new ssh key files
- if they are not already correct, change them to:
  - `id_rsa.pub` should be set to `-rw-r--r--`
  - `id_rsa` should be set to `-rw-------`
- congrats, you've made an ssh key, now we just need to get the public key onto another server so we can use it.
- cat out the _public_ key and copy it
- next, one time we're going to `ssh` into the practice machine I made using a password. To do that, type `ssh <your-name>@ssh-practice.howtocomputer.link`. The password is the one I showed you in class yesterday.,
- once you're connected to the practice computer, make a `~/.ssh` folder and inside it, create an `authorized_keys` file that contains **one line** -- the ssh public key you copied in step 15.
- exit out of the practice computer, which will bring you back to the HTC computer.
- now, you should be able to connect to the practice computer **without being prompted for a password**. Try it by typing `ssh <yourname>@ssh-practice.howtocomputer.link`. If you get in without typing the password, it worked! If not, try to review the previous steps carefully checking if you did each on correct.
- log out of the practice computer, back to the HTC computer.
- next, create a file with something in it that will make it so that you don't have to supply the `<yourname>@` part of the ssh command. Review the "new stuff" if you're not sure what to do. You'll know you did it correctly if you can ssh directly to the practice computer by typing **only** `ssh ssh-practice.howtocomputer.link`.

---

### SSH Homework #2

- complete SSH homework #1 first
- on your _own computer_, cd into your home dir, and create an `.ssh` dir if it doesn't exist.
- `cd` into the `~/.ssh` dir, and do a `ls` to make sure there's not already a `id_rsa` key pair. If there is (which I doubt), Slack me and I'll tell you what to do.
- use the same command from part 1 of the ssh homework to _generate a ssh key pair_, and then make sure that the permissions are correct.
- `ls` and `cat` to see that you have made a new pair, and look inside both of them for fun.
- **BEFORE** you try to use the key, we're going to do 2 or 3 extra steps to make sure this works.
- first, in your shell, type this command exactly (you don't need to understand what it does): `eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"`
- the second step is **only for Mac computers**, skip if you're not on a Mac. If you are on a Mac, create a `~/.ssh/config` file and put these lines in it:

```bash
Host *
  AddKeysToAgent yes
  UseKeychain yes
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

-- third, if you're on a Mac computer, type `ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_rsa`. If you're on Linux type: `ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa`

- after all that, copy your new public key to a `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file **on the HTC computer**.
- log out of the HTC computer and test if you can make a connection _without entering your password_.
- assuming you got that working, modify the ssh config file on your own computer so that you also don't need to type your name.
- if you did all the steps right (and my instructions are good ü§û) then you should now be able to ssh into the HTC computer by only typing `ssh howtocomputer.link`.

## GitLab Homework

---

- do the SSH homework (both parts) first
- visit [gitlab.howtocomputer.link](https://gitlab.howtocomputer.link) and click the "Register" tab. Fill out the form to create a new account, making sure to remember your password.
- once you're logged in, send me a Slack so I can add you to the **How to Computer** _group_.
- spend a few minutes (but not too long, OK?) clicking around and exploring all the places you can go. See how many of them you can understand.
- find the place where you can set your profile picture, and upload a picture
- try to find the **group** I made called `How to Computer`. Once you find it, click into one or two of the repositories. Try to get a little familiar with how GitLab gives you a _webpage_ view of a git repository.
- find the place in GitLab where you can paste a ssh public key. Once you find it, log into the HTC computer, then cat out and copy the public key you made in SSH Homework #1. Paste it into the GitLab web UI and **give it the name** `howtocomputer.link machine` so you don't get confused later if you add another key.
- try to find the main repository webpage for the _homework site_ repo. It's one of the repos in the HTC _group_. You'll know you're on the right page if you see _a BLUE clone button_ in the upper right, but don't click it! If after poking around for a little while, you can't find it, [click here](https://gitlab.howtocomputer.link/htc/homework-site) to go straight there.
- on that page, look at the URL in the browser's address bar, you'll see it ends with `/htc/homework-site`. The **pattern** is this: `/<owner>/<repo>`. So in this case, `htc` is the owner (that's the _group_ I made) and `homework-site` is the slug of the _repo itself_. Does that make sense?
- next, find the **fork** button in the upper right of the page and click it. Choose to fork it into your own name (that will be the only option).
- once forking is complete, you should be taken to the webpage for _your own copy of the repo_. Look at the URL in the browser address bar again. Do you see how it changed? Does it make sense what the two parts of the URL are?
- now, here on your forked copy of the repo, **click the blue clone button** and then _copy the `ssh` url_.
- next, `ssh` into your home dir. You're now going to _clone_ the homework site right into your home dir. To do that, type `git clone <the-url-you-copied>`. If the clone is successful, that means you got your ssh key set up correctly. Hooray!
- now cd into the `homework-site` dir that git created for you when you cloned.
- type a command to see if you have any git remotes. Do you understand why you have one, and why it is called what it is?
- type a command to see more information about the git remotes -- you should be able to see that your `origin` remote is coming from gitlab. Cool, huh?
- make a new branch name (called whatever you want) and switch to it.
- open the file that contains the page you're reading right now, it is (from the repo root dir) in the path `src/markdown-pages/week-31.md` -- open it with vim.
- don't worry if you don't understand all of what you see (it's written in a format called `markdown` which I haven't taught you yet, but it's similar to how you can type special things in Slack)
- Find part of this homework page that you think could be improved or made more clear. If you noticed a mistake, or something like that, use vim's search feature to find that chunk in the code. Once you found something to change, make the change and commit your work.
- commit your work
- next you're going to _push your branch up to your own fork on GitLab_ (try telling that to your mom and see what she says, haha). To do this, you'll use the `git push` command, in the format: `git push <remote> <branch>`.
- if you did it right, you should see a URL show up in the _terminal output_ offering you to **create a Merge Request**. You can either copy that URL, or try holding down command or control and clicking right on it. Most terminals will allow you to click a URL if you hold down command or control. But if clicking doesn't work, just copy the URL and paste it into a new tab of your web browser.
- on the Merge Request screen, edit the title and description to give me a nice explanation of why I should merge your changes, then click to **submit** the PR.
- slack me with the URL of your Merge request so I can look it over!

---

## Web Homework

---

- go to the HTC _group_ on GitLab, and find the repo called `week-31-cars`
- make your own **fork** of the repo
- clone the repo down into a `~/www/week31` dir that you create after ssh-ing in to the HTC computer.
- once it's cloned, cd into the repo, and make and switch to a **new branch**.
- edit the `app.js` file:
- turn the big string I gave you into a nice usable array (hint: the name of the variable should give you clue) -- this can be done in **one line of javascript**
- map over the array you have, creating a `li` dom node for each, containing the _name_ of each car (this is very similar to last weeks homework)
- use `Array.forEach` to insert each list item into the Dom, into the `ul` element I gave you.
- commit your work
- You should see a list of a handful of car names
- next, edit your code so that each list item also displays the _horsepower_, and adds a sad emoji if the car is _out of stock_
- commit your work.
- change you code now to remove the "out of stock" emoji. Instead, use `Array.filter` to _only show cars that are in stock_.
- commit your work.
- if you didn't already use them, refactor your code to use an _arrow_ function for the _predicate_ passed to `Array.filter()`
- commit your work.
- submit me a Merge Request, and then slack me the Merge Request URL.
- When I get the MR, I'm going to review your code and make a few suggestions for improvements. You'll need to address my feedback, make a new commit, and push back up your branch.
- after you address my feedback, I'm going to give you each one or two more mini-features that I want you to implement, but I'll communicate this through the MR. You'll need to implement the mini-feature/s I request, and then push up another commit.
- I'll have one more quick step for you to do after that, that I'll tell you about when you get there.
