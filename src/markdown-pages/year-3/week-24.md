## Monkey #36 üêí

---

- Read slowly and carefully the next section, labled **"Hashes Objects"**
- You probably shouldn't attempt to do this one without watching the video, so
  follow along with the video, since our TypeScript psuedo hashing function
  differs from his a lot.
- [Video link](https://flp-assets.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/storage/htc-videos/monkey/46--4.5-object-hash-keys.mp4)
- Submit a MR, **Review your diffs and fixup!!**, then slack the MR url

---

## Monkey #37 üêí

---

- You know the drill. Work through the final few sections, referring to the
  videos below _as needed_.
- [Video #1 - Evaluating Hash Literals](https://flp-assets.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/storage/htc-videos/monkey/47--4.5-eval-hashes.mp4)
- [Video #2 - Evaluating Hash Index Expressions + Grand Finale](https://flp-assets.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/storage/htc-videos/monkey/48--4.5-eval-hash-index-puts.mp4)
- Submit a MR, **Review your diffs and fixup!!**, then slack the MR url
- Congratulations! You have finished the Monkey book! üòä

## Flashcards API Cleanup Assignment #2 üßº

---

- Make sure you've addressed any feedback from the last Flashcards API cleanup
  assignment, and merged, etc.
- Make a new branch called `cleanup-2`.
- Watch and implement the changes in
  [Video #3](https://flp-assets.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/storage/htc-videos/flashcards/25--cleanup-response-mock-helpers.mp4)
  which has to do with _making testing of responses simpler and less
  boiler-platey_.
- Commit your work.
- Watch and implement the changes in
  [Video #4a](https://flp-assets.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/storage/htc-videos/flashcards/26--cleanup-response-type-pt1.mp4)
  and
  [Video #4b](https://flp-assets.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/storage/htc-videos/flashcards/27--cleanup-response-type-pt2.mp4)
  which has to do with _tightening up typescript Response types, and error
  codes_.
- Commit your work.
- The next short video (only 8 minutes), I want you to watch, but you are not
  required to implement the changes, unless you want to.
  [Video #5](https://flp-assets.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/storage/htc-videos/flashcards/28--cleanup-logging.mp4)
  -- has to do with _a logging abstraction_.
- Submit a MR.
- Watch and implement the changes in
  [Video #6](https://flp-assets.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/storage/htc-videos/flashcards/29--cleanup-middleware.mp4)
  which has to do with _creating a user authentication **middleware**_.
- Commit your work.
- Submit a MR.

## Flashcards API (non-cleanup) Assignment

---

- Make sure you've finished your **cleanup #2** assignment first. I'll try to
  review those MRs quickly, so you can merge and get started on this assignment.
- Pull from master, etc. etc., make a new branch.
- Start by modifing the `GET /cards` routes so that it _also sends back the
  **category id**_ for each card. We'll use this later in the web app. Modify
  your types and tests as needed.
- Commit your work.
- Create a **new migration** that adds a **user_id** foreign key to the
  `categories` table:
  - You can model it off of the migration that added a user id to the `cards`
    table, in that you can do it two parts: first supplying a default of the
    admin user supplied by your `.env` file, and second, by removing the
    default.
  - make sure your down works (you'll need to drop the foreign key relation
    before you can drop the column using syntax like:
    `ALTER TABLE some_table DROP FOREIGN KEY fk_relation_name`)
  - check all your route responder and database functions that have to do with
    editing/inserting a category, they will all now have to take and return a
    **user id** as well. Take a few minutes to carefully think this through and
    make the required adjustments.
- Commit your work.
- Create a `GET /categories` route that returns _all the categories_ that belong
  to the user, with these stipulations:
  - it should be protected using the middleware you created in the last
    assignment
  - because our `categories` table doesn't have **user ids**, you'll need to use
    the user id from the header-authed user to _join on the cards table_ to
    **only get the categories that belong to the authed user**.
  - return all the columns in the `categories` table (you can camel-case them if
    you like, for easier consumption on the web-app side)
  - this will involve a new route responder, and a new db method
  - write a couple tests for you new route
  - write a test route into your `api.http` file
- commit your work
- Next, add a `GET /cards/:id` route, which returns the json data for **a single
  card**, with these stipulations:
  - protect the route with our user auth middleware
  - make sure the authed user owns the card requested
  - return a resource that represents _every column_ in the cards table, not the
    same exact resource we return an array of for `GET /cards` -- maybe call the
    resource `CardRow`. You can camel-case the column names if you want, but
    make sure they're all present.
  - this will involve a new route responder, and a new db method
  - write a couple tests for you new route
  - write a test route into your `api.http` file
- Next, add a `GET /categories/:id` route, which returns the json data for **a
  single category**, with these stipulations:
  - protect the route with our user auth middleware
  - make sure the authed user owns the category requested
  - return the same resource type as `GET /categories` does
  - this will involve a new route responder, and a new db method
  - write a couple tests for you new route
  - write a test route into your `api.http` file

## King C Assignment üëë

---

- Slowly and Carefully read chapter 19 of King C.
- No exercizes or projects this week. üëç

---

## Speller

---

- **Note:** `Speller` is technically part of _next week's homework_, but since
  canoe trip, and etc, and some of you are working ahead, I put it here, you're
  welcome to start it.
- Make sure you've watched all of CS50, thru to the end, first.
- Also, make sure you've read (if you haven't already),
  [this page](https://craftinginterpreters.com/hash-tables.html) (thru section
  `20.3`)
- **Slowly and carefully** read the
  [assignment from the CS50 site](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2019/fall/psets/5/speller/).
- If you're feeling a little daunted, ask your parent to allow you to watch
  these Youtube videos, which are the "walkthrough" videos made by CS50 for this
  assignment (about 25 minutes total):
  - [Walkthrough #1 - speller](https://htc-viewer.netlify.app/?id=_z57x5PGF4w)
  - [Walkthrough #2 - load](https://htc-viewer.netlify.app/?id=-BX4wLZRwbc)
  - [Walkthrough #3 - hash](https://htc-viewer.netlify.app/?id=mMj9ZmcB6ls)
  - [Walkthrough #4 - size](https://htc-viewer.netlify.app/?id=3cD-_NGTw9A)
  - [Walkthrough #5 - check](https://htc-viewer.netlify.app/?id=qPz_Mr69yE0)
  - [Walkthrough #6 - unload](https://htc-viewer.netlify.app/?id=qkC4l0pUvCk)
- **FORK this repo**:
  [https://gitlab.howtocomputer.link/htc/cs50-speller](https://gitlab.howtocomputer.link/htc/cs50-speller),
  then _clone YOUR fork_.
- make a new branch
- make sure you did the last step
- to get all of the texts and dictionaries and "keys", you'll need to run a
  command I put into the Makefile. run `make download` in your terminal. It will
  take a few seconds, but when it's done, you should have some (git-ignored)
  directories: `keys/`, `dictionaries/` and `texts/`.
- To compile your code, I recommend using the default Makefile tarket by running
  just `make`.
- Complete the task as outlined in the CS50 website.
- Check that you're getting the correct results by comparing your output with
  the `keys/*` files.
- Submit a MR, slack me the URL.
- If you want to be part of a friendly HTC competition for speed, clone your
  solution down onto the HTC pi (so that we're all benchmarking on the same
  hardware), and run your speller code against the "bible" text. My total speed
  was `3.45` seconds on the PI. See if you can beat that. :)
