- Address all feedback from prior MR's, and merge.
- Create a new branch.
- Double-check that you did the first two steps.
- Start where you left of last time, **after** the _3.8 Abort! Abort!_ section,
  which is labeled **3.9 Bindings and the Environment**. Complete the section.
- Commit your work.
- As always, make sure to try to do as much as you can without the videos, but
  always also watch the videos and update your code to (mostly) match.
- [Video link](https://flp-assets.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/storage/htc-videos/monkey/35--3.9-bindings-env.mp4)
