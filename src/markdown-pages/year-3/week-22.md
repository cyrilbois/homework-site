## Flashcards API assignment #1

---

- Make sure you've addressed all feedback from any prior MRs, and merged.
- read all these instructions from beginning to end before starting
- this homework has a video, you can use it if you need it, but try first to do
  it without (link at the end)
- Implement a new API route: `POST /categories`, as I described in class, with
  the presence or lack of an `id` field being the differentiator between whether
  we are _editing_ a category, or _creating_ a category
- _Regarding the methods/functions etc, outlined below: you are encouraged to
  change the **names** of the methods, arguments, or even the **shape/types** of
  the arguments, to match your naming convention and personal coding style. The
  naming and type signatures aren't a requirement, but they do show you **what
  information you almost certainly will need for each function**_.
- Below are a some hints and requirements:
- you will need to end up adding **_3_** new _database methods_:

  - one to return a `User` row/resource from a _token_:

  ```ts
  getUserFromToken: (token: string) => Promise<Result<Omit<UserRow, 'password'>>>;
  ```

  - one to insert a new category:

  ```ts
  insertCategory: (name: string) => Promise<Result<CategoryRow>>;
  ```

  - edit an existing category:

  ```ts
  editCategory: (
    id: string,
    name: string,
  ) => Promise<Result<Pick<CategoryRow, 'id' | 'name'>>>;
  ```

- you will need add a new "route responder" for editing a category:

```ts
updateCategory(
  db: Database,
  authorizationHeader: string | undefined,
  body: any
): Promise<Response>;
```

- the route responder method shown above takes a `authorizationHeader` param for
  a basic authorization sanity check, using `db.getUserFromToken(...)`. That
  method on the db will be used more extensively in Part 2 of this homework, but
  we'll also use it in this `updateCategory()` route responder to do a _sanity
  check_ that we have a valid authenticated user making the request. What I mean
  by that is, inside the route responder you should:
  - pull the _bearer token_ from the header (like you do in the `GET /cards`
    route)
  - then call `db.getUserFromToken()`
  - if you get a valid user, fine, proceed (without using any of the actual user
    data)
  - if you can't find a valid user, immediately return with an "unauthorized"
    message/status -- only valid authenticated users are allowed to use this
    route.
  - you might find some commonality between this responder and the `getCards`
    responder, in the code that pulls the token from the header, and it might be
    worth factoring out some duplication in a helper method.
- the route responder takes as it's `body` argument the _parsed JSON body_,
  which is why it's an `any`. In order to extract valid, _type-safe_ info from
  the parsed json blob, I want you to make a function like this (where if the
  data is not valid, it returns `null`):

```ts
function validCategoryData(body: any): null | {
  id?: string; // üëã `id` is optional
  name: string;
};
```

- the route responder will call that method with the `body: any` argument it
  gets passed. If it gets `null` back, the request was not valid, so it can
  return a "400/Bad Request" response. If it gets some non-null valid data, it
  will use that to safely pass arguments on to the database methods.
- your route responder should be **extensively tested**, including
  - asserting that you get a "400/Bad Request" response if you pass in invalid
    `body` data.
  - asserting that the database method to _insert a category_ is called when an
    `id` is NOT present
  - asserting that the database method to _edit a category_ is called when an
    `id` IS present
  - covering failure and error cases
- you must add a two new requests to your `api.http` that allows you to test
  adding and updating a category.
- commit your work
- Push up a MR
- Review your diffs
- Slack me the MR
- When I approve your MR **don't merge it**, then you may continue to part 2.

## Flashcards API Assignment #2

---

- Make sure you've addressed all feedback from from your WIP/partial MR in part
  1 of the assignment.
- read all these instructions from beginning to end before starting
- this homework _does not have a video_, but is conceptually very similar to
  part 1, only with a couple more bits of data because the `cards` table has
  more columns than the `categories` table. But all the concepts are the same,
  so you should be able to follow the outline of your work for part 1, and do it
  mostly the same.
- Implement a new API route: `POST /cards`, as I described in class, with the
  presence or lack of an `id` field being the differentiator between whether we
  are _editing_ a card, or _creating_ a card
- Below are a some hints and requirements:
- you will need to end up adding **_2_** new _database methods_:

  - one to insert a new card:

  ```ts
  insertCard(
    userId: string,
    categoryId: string,
    front: string,
    back: string,
  ): Promise<Result<Pick<Card, 'id' | 'title' | 'back'>>>;
  ```

  - edit an existing card: `editCategory(id: string, name: string)`

  ```ts
  editCard(
    id: string,
    categoryId: string,
    front: string,
    back: string,
  ): Promise<Result<Pick<Card, 'id' | 'title' | 'back'>>>;
  ```

- you will need add a new "route responder" for editing a card:

```ts
updateCard(
  db: Database,
  authorizationHeader: string | undefined,
  body: any
): Promise<Response>;
```

- This route responder also uses `db.getUserFromToken()`, but for **2 reasons**
  -- authentication, and getting the users id for foreign key relations --
  (unlike the `updateCategory()` responder, which used it _only_ for
  authentication)
- the route responder also takes as it's `body` argument the _parsed JSON body_,
  which is why it's an `any`. Make another input/body validator function:

```ts
function validCardData(body: any): null | {
  id?: string; // `id` optional again
  categoryId: string;
  front: string;
  back: string;
};
```

- the route responder will call that method with the `body: any` argument it
  gets passed. If it gets `null` back, the request was not valid, so it can
  return a "400/Bad Request" response. If it gets some non-null valid data, it
  will use that to safely pass arguments on to the database methods.
- your route responder should be **extensively tested**, including
  - asserting that you get a "400/Bad Request" response if you pass in invalid
    `body` data.
  - asserting that the database method to _insert a card_ is called when an `id`
    is NOT present
  - asserting that the database method to _edit a card_ is called when an `id`
    IS present
  - covering failure and error cases
- you must add a two new requests to your `api.http` that allows you to test
  adding and updating a card.
- commit your work
- Push up a MR
- Review your diffs
- Slack me the MR

## Monkey #31 üêí

---

- Address all feedback from prior MR, and merge.
- Create a new branch.
- Double-check that you did the first two steps.
- Start at the _beginning_ of the section titled: **4.4 Arrays**
- Stop at the beginning of the sub-section titled **Parsing Index Operator
  Expressions**, at the top of page 169 (PDF), or the middle of 213 (printed),
  right where he says `We can mark ‚Äúparsing array literals‚Äù as ‚Äúdone‚Äù.`
- Commit your work.
- As always, make sure to try to do as much as you can without the videos, but
  always also watch the videos and update your code to (mostly) match.
- [Video link](https://flp-assets.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/storage/htc-videos/monkey/41--4.4-parse-array-literals.mp4)
- Submit a MR, **Review your diffs and fixup!!**, then slack the MR url
