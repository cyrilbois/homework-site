## King C Chapter 6 Projects üëë

---

- First, make sure you've slowly and carefully read all of chapter 5 of King C.
  assignment.
- TODO, any preparatory comments?
- Merge your `king-c` repo branch from last week, and **CREATE A NEW BRANCH**.
- Complete the following programming projects (not _exercizes_) from chapter 3,
  making a new file for every one:
  - `1`
  - `2`
  - `3` _Hint:_ extract a simple function (no need for pointers) from project
    #2, and use that to make this one quite easy.
  - `5`
  - `6`
  - `8`
  - `10` _Hint:_ extract a function from your code from last week, it should not
    need any pointers, just take enough arguments to analyze two dates, and
    return some value that means either "date 1 is earlier" or "date 2 is
    earlier". Use that function to make this one pretty easy.
  - `11` **Extra Credit‚ú®**
- commit your work, and push up a MR on GitLab
- before you slack me the URL, review your own diffs, clean up anything you
  notice, then slack me the URL.

## Monkey #13 (Prefix Operators) üêí

---

- Address all feedback from prior MR's, and merge.
- Create a new branch.
- Start in the middle of section **2.6**, in the section labeled **Prefix
  Operators**. Work through that section, and stop when you get to the section
  labeled **Infix Operators**.
- As always, try to do as much as you can on your own, leaning on the videos
  when you get stuck. But also, make sure to watch the videos and update your
  code accordingly.
