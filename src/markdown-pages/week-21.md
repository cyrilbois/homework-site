# Week 21 Homework üíª üèπ

_New stuff we learned this week:_ ü§î

## Flexbox üèπ üî´

- For a full review of Flexbox, see [this page.](/flexbox-properties)

## CSS

- CSS selectors can be combined with a _space_, so the selector `#some-div img` means "target `img` elements inside the element with the `id` of `some-div`.
- there can be any number of levels of combining selectors in this way, like these:

```CSS
body #my-div .foobar ul li {
  /* target lists inside of unordered lists
     inside of elements with class "foobar"
     inside of an element with the id of "my-div"
     inside the body element */
}

p em {
  /* target only `em` tags that are INSIDE of `p` tags */
}
```
