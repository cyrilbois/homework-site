# Week 14 Homework 💻 🐈

_New stuff we learned this week:_ 🤔

#### Vim

#### CSS

- a `display: inline` element doesn't let you set `width` and `height`
- `display: inline-block` is like `display: inline` except it respects `width` and `height` -- and it does _NOT_ make a new line like `display: block`
- the `width` attribute lets you set the _width_ of an element, but only if it's `display` property is `block` or `inline-block`
- the `height` attribute lets you set the _height_ of an element, but only if it's `display` property is `block` or `inline-block`
