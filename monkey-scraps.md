## Monkey #33 üêí

- Address all feedback from prior MR, and merge.
- Create a new branch.
- Double-check that you did the first two steps.
- Start where we left off last time, at the _beginning_ of the sub-section
  titled **Evaluating Array Literals** (p. 172 pdf, p. 217 printed).
- Complete the two sub-sections labeled **Evaluating Array Literals**, and
  **Evaluating Index Operator Expressions**.
- Commit your work.
- As always, make sure to try to do as much as you can without the videos, but
  always also watch the videos and update your code to (mostly) match.
