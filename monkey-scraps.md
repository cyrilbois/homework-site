## Monkey #26 üêí
---

- Address all feedback from prior MR's, and merge.
- Create a new branch.
- Double-check that you did the first two steps.
- Start where you left of last time, **after** the _3.9 Bindings and the
  Environment_ section, which is labeled **3.10 Functions and Function Calls**.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **DONT COMPLETE all of 3.10**. Instead, _stop_ üõë in the middle of page 143
  (pdf) or 181 (print), where he gets the tests passing and starts by saying
  `Easy right? The test passes.`.
- Commit your work.
- As always, make sure to try to do as much as you can without the videos, but
  always also watch the videos and update your code to (mostly) match.

## Monkey #27 - Cleaning Rampage Edition üêí üßº

---

- Address all feedback from prior MR's, and merge.
- Create a new branch.
- Double-check that you did the first two steps.
- For this one, just watch my video and do the same basic steps in your code.
  This is not stuff he shows in the book, it's just that I decided it was time
  to clean up and quasi "namespace" all our imports, as you'll see.
